# 📊 8 Week SQL Case Study Challenge

### **📌 Overview**

  This repository contains my SQL Query solutions to the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) created by Danny Ma. Danny Ma launched the eight-week SQL challenge, which comprises of eight distinct SQL challenges, through the Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program.


The project focuses entirely on writing, structuring, and optimizing SQL queries to solve real-world business problems.
There is no application code in this repository — it is intentionally kept purely SQL-focused.

Each case-study folder contains the following files

- A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
- SQL file to create the schema, tables and loading data
- MD files which contains SQL queries answering the respective challenge questions
