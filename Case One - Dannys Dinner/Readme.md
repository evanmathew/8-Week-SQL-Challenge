- **sales:** The sales table captures all customer_id level purchases with an corresponding order_date and product_id information for when and what menu items were ordered.
- **menu:** The menu table maps the product_id to the actual product_name and price of each menu item.
- **members:** The members table captures the join_date when a customer_id joined the beta version of the Danny’s Diner loyalty program.
